# Multithreading

Multithreading in Java allows you to create and manage multiple threads of execution within a single Java program. Multithreading is beneficial when you want to perform multiple tasks concurrently, improve the performance of your application, or provide responsiveness to user interactions. Here are the key concepts and steps for working with multithreading in Java:

1. **Create a Thread:**
   You can create a thread in Java by extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface.

   - Extending `Thread` class:

   ```java
   class MyThread extends Thread {
       public void run() {
           // Thread's code here
       }
   }
   ```

   - Implementing `Runnable` interface:

   ```java
   class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
       public void run() {
           // Thread's code here
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Instantiate and Start a Thread:**
   To create and start a thread, you need to create an instance of the thread class and call the `start()` method on that instance.

   - For a `Thread`-based class:

   ```java
   MyThread myThread = new MyThread();
   myThread.start();
   ```

   - For a `Runnable`-based class:

   ```java
   MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
   Thread thread = new Thread(myRunnable);
   thread.start();
   ```

3. **Run Method:**
   The `run()` method is the entry point of the thread. You need to override the `run()` method with the code that you want the thread to execute.

4. **Thread Execution:**
   When the `start()` method is called, a new thread is created and scheduled for execution. The `run()` method of the thread is invoked when the thread starts.

5. **Concurrency and Synchronization:**
   When multiple threads access shared resources, you may need to use synchronization mechanisms like `synchronized` blocks or locks to avoid race conditions and ensure data consistency.

6. **Thread Termination:**
   Threads can exit their execution either by returning from the `run()` method or by throwing an unhandled exception.

7. **Thread Priorities:**
   You can assign thread priorities using the `setPriority()` method. Thread priorities help the scheduler decide which thread to execute when there are multiple threads ready to run.

8. **Daemon Threads:**
   Threads can be marked as daemon threads, which are background threads that do not prevent the program from exiting when all user threads have finished executing.

9. **Thread Joining:**
   You can use the `join()` method to wait for a thread to complete its execution before proceeding with the main thread or other tasks.

10. **Thread Pooling:**
    Java provides thread pooling through the `Executor` framework, which includes thread pools for managing and reusing threads efficiently.

11. **Concurrency Utilities:**
    The `java.util.concurrent` package offers various utilities for handling multithreading tasks, such as data structures, thread pools, and synchronization constructs.

Remember that multithreading introduces complexities, including the need to manage shared resources and potential issues like deadlock and race conditions. Proper synchronization and thread management practices are crucial for successful multithreading in Java.

## A Note on Best Practices
In general, it is best to avoid implementing multithreading yourself if possible. The benefit of multithreaded applications is better performance due to non-blocking execution. However, you should always measure or attempt to estimate the performance benefit you will get by using threads versus the tradeoff in complexity and subtle bugs that might be generated. Usually there are frameworks, tools, or libraries that have implemented the problem you are trying to solve, and you can leverage those instead of trying to build your own solution. For example, web servers like Apache Tomcat have multithreading built-in and provide APIs for dealing with network requests without having to worry about threads.
