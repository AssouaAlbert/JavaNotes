# Thread Livelock
Livelock is another concurrency problem and is similar to deadlock. In livelock, two or more threads keep on transferring states between one another instead of waiting infinitely as we saw in the deadlock example. Consequently, the threads are not able to perform their respective tasks.

- A great example of livelock is a messaging system where, when an exception occurs, the message consumer rolls back the transaction and puts the message back to the head of the queue. Then the same message is repeatedly read from the queue, only to cause another exception and be put back on the queue. The consumer will never pick up any other message from the queue.
