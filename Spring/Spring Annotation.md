# Spring Annotations

Spring Framework provides a wide range of annotations that help in configuring and managing various aspects of your Spring-based applications. Here are some of the most commonly used Spring annotations:

1. **@Autowired**: Used for automatic dependency injection. It can be applied to fields, constructors, and methods.

2. **@Component**: Indicates that a class is a Spring-managed component, which is automatically detected by component scanning.

3. **@Configuration**: Indicates that a class defines Spring bean configurations. It's used in conjunction with `@Bean` methods.

4. **@Bean**: Used in `@Configuration` classes to define methods that return Spring beans.

5. **@Service**: A specialization of `@Component`, used to annotate service classes.

6. **@Repository**: A specialization of `@Component`, used to annotate data access or repository classes.

7. **@Controller**: A specialization of `@Component`, used to annotate classes that handle web requests.

8. **@RequestMapping**: Used in controller classes to map HTTP requests to specific handler methods.

9. **@PathVariable**: Used to extract values from the URI path in request mappings.

10. **@RequestParam**: Used to bind request parameters to method parameters in request mappings.

11. **@ResponseBody**: Used to indicate that the return value of a method should be written directly to the response body.

12. **@RestController**: A combination of `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, commonly used in RESTful web services.

13. **@ConfigurationProperties**: Used to bind external configuration properties to Java objects.

14. **@Value**: Used for injecting values from property files or environment variables into fields.

15. **@Qualifier**: Used in combination with `@Autowired` to specify the bean to be injected when multiple beans of the same type are available.

16. **@Profile**: Used to specify that a bean should be registered for a specific profile.

17. **@PostConstruct**: Specifies a method to be executed after the bean is initialized.

18. **@PreDestroy**: Specifies a method to be executed before the bean is destroyed.

19. **@Transactional**: Used for declarative transaction management. It marks a method as transactional.

20. **@Async**: Used to indicate that a method should be executed asynchronously.

21. **@PostConstruct**: Is used to configure the init method, It is called after the bean has been constructed and initialized.

22. **@PreDestroy**: It is used to specify a method that should be called just before a bean or object is removed or destroyed by the container.

These annotations are a subset of the annotations provided by the Spring Framework. The choice of which annotations to use depends on the specific requirements of your application. Spring annotations help reduce boilerplate code and make the configuration and management of Spring components more concise and expressive.
