# @Value vs @PropertySource

`@Value` and `@PropertySource` are both annotations in the Spring Framework used for working with external properties or configuration values, but they serve slightly different purposes:

1. **@Value Annotation**:

   - `@Value` is used to inject property values from various sources (such as property files, environment variables, system properties, etc.) directly into Spring beans or components.

   - You can use `@Value` to inject a property value into a field, method, or constructor parameter.

   - It is often used for injecting individual property values.

   - It can be used to resolve placeholder values, such as `${my.property}`.

   - You typically place `@Value` on a field or method.

   Example:

   ```java
   @Component
   public class MyComponent {
       @Value("${my.property}")
       private String myProperty;

       // ...
   }
   ```

2. **@PropertySource Annotation**:

   - `@PropertySource` is used to specify the location of one or more property files that should be loaded into the Spring environment.

   - It allows you to load property files into the Spring `Environment`, making their values available for injection using `@Value` annotations.

   - It is often used when you need to load multiple properties from a specific file or when you want to define the source of the properties.

   - You typically place `@PropertySource` on a `@Configuration` class.

   Example:

   ```java
   @Configuration
   @PropertySource("classpath:my-properties.properties")
   public class MyConfiguration {
       // ...
   }
   ```

   In this example, the properties defined in the "my-properties.properties" file can be accessed using `@Value` annotations within beans defined in the configuration class.

In summary, `@Value` is used to inject individual property values directly into Spring beans, while `@PropertySource` is used to specify the location of property files to load into the Spring environment, making the properties available for injection using `@Value` annotations. You often use both in conjunction, with `@PropertySource` defining the source of properties and `@Value` being used to access those properties.

## @Value("${my.property}")

The `${my.property}` placeholder in `@Value("${my.property}")` can be resolved from various sources, depending on how your Spring application is configured. The resolution order is as follows:

1. **application.properties/application.yml**:
   If you have an `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file in your project's classpath, Spring will look for the property value in this default configuration file. If the property is defined in `application.properties`, it will be resolved from there by default.

2. **Specified Property Files**:
   If you've specified a property file using `@PropertySource` in your Spring configuration, Spring will also look in that specified property file for the property value. For example, if you have the following `@PropertySource`:

   ```java
   @Configuration
   @PropertySource("classpath:custom.properties")
   public class MyConfiguration {
       // ...
   }
   ```

   Spring will check the "custom.properties" file for the `my.property` value if it's not found in `application.properties`.

3. **System Properties and Environment Variables**:
   If the property is not found in the above sources, Spring will check system properties and environment variables for the value of `my.property`.

This order of property resolution allows you to provide default properties in `application.properties`, override them with specific properties in custom property files (if specified), and finally provide property values through system properties or environment variables.
